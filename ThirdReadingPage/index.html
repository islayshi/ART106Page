      <h1>Third Reading</h1>


      <h2>Part 1 </h2>
      <h3> Q1. Summerize the interview of James Bridle and his book. in your own words. Specifically list out at least 4 topics that get discussed. Use complete senetances. </h3>
      <p>As suggested in the title, Bridle discusses animals, plants, machines, and all their drives to stay alive and function. While nature and man-made machine seem very different and may seem like they inherently oppose each other, that doesn't always have to be the case, as a lot of times both can benefit from one another. For instance, a lot of machinery and technology have advancements that are closely modeled to animal or plant behavior.</p>

      <h3>Q2. From the article on James Bridle's book. Bridle describes the work of Biologist Jakob von Uexkull who coined the term “umwelt”. What is the defination of this word and what was the example sited. Lastly describe another example in your
        words of the umvelt of another plant or animal.</h3>

        <p>The term was originall coined to describe the point of view of a certain organizlism. The interview and article discusses the "umwelt" of certain creatures, whether it be plants, insects, or animals themselves. The example the speficially cite involves a tick parasite, which uses the odor of a certain kind of acid, the temperature of warm blood, and the hairiness of mammals. These are all factors that contribute to the umwelt of this specific organism. The umwelt of a dolphin for example, would be the frequency of their echolocation, the smell of their food, as well as the presence of other fellow dolphins.</p>

      <h2>Part 2</h2>
      <h3>Q3. Create a list of attributes that any living thing possesses, that could be adopted or insprired by to apply to the field of robotics. Can you think of things that any living creature are good that the could be useful from a physical,
        behavior based or aesthetically derivedperspective for a technology to utilize.
        Think of specific traits, from specific species.
        Specifically, Make a list of at least 3 from the plant kingdom.
        Make another list of 3 examples from the animal or microrganism world.</h3>
        <p>For the plant kingdom, I can think of: the desire to sense and reach out to sunlight for photosynthesis, meaning a good sense of direction, proper soil/dirt for growth and prospering, so a good foundatation, as well as the ability go grow and adapt to certain surroudnings, like how plants will grow in the direction of better resources or use their roots to expand and cast a wider net. </p>

        <p> Regarding the animal kingdom: the olfactory senses/desire to sniff out food, easy mobility for crossing the habitat that suits the animal, as well as homeostasis, the ability to keep the body stable and optimized. </p>

      <h3>Q4. Based on Bridle book other ideas of hybrid creatures, share your speculative ideas for 2 different systems where technology and the living world could enter into a some kind of symbiotic and mutualism based relationship. Something where
        they both have agency, worth and particapation.</h3>
        <p>-Humans can allow for wearable plants, by venturing outside with their merchandise, they can also allow for their plants to get the sunlight and preciptation that is needed for them to further grow and prosper. By allowing for plants to prosper as the human goes outside, a symbiotic relationship is established</p>

        <p>-Another example of mutualism would be having mechanical animals spread pollen or seeds around a habitat. Plants allow for animals to feed and to provide clean air, and animals using their hair or fur, as well as their footsteps can further spread seeds and cross pollination.</p>
